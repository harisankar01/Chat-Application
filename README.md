## Installation

The project is split into, the `public` folder is the frontend of the application build using react and the `server` folder is the backend of the application build using nodejs. See the respective folders for installation and local development informations.

## Usage

## Security

JWT-based security is provided throughout the application with Firebase token verification. Each user has a unique token that is generated by Firebase upon registration. This token is used to authenticate the user on each request made to the server. Any request that does not have a valid token is rejected by the server.

## Database

Google MySQL instance is used as the database for the chat application. The messages between the users are stored in Firebase Real-Time Database.

Cloudinary is used to store user profile pictures. Users can either upload their own pictures or select an avatar from Multiavatar API.
